# # About The Project
## Description
this is a daily planner webiste.

The planner is layed out in daily business hours. It displays the current day at
the top of the page. It has hours listed on the<br/>
left side of the page, events that can be clicked and changed in the middle of
the page and save buttons for the events on the <br/>right side.
<br/>
It is an easy and intuitive system that you can use to set up your daily work
life or maybe you are a person who loves to origize<br/> your day routine.
<br/>
This page uses the local storage in Google Chrome to store what you input for events. The
info that you input for the events is then stored<br/> in local storage and saved.
When the page is refreshed or closed and reopened it will load the saved events.
